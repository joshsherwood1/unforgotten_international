<h2>The world is so much bigger than the bubble you live in</h2>
<p>I learned this lesson the hard way. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My beloved brother was taken hostage by the Islamic Republic 4 days ago in order to try and silence me. I haven‚Äôt seen him for 10 yrs bc I‚Äôm not allowed to visit my homeland and he‚Äôs not allowed to leave it.

<p>Here is what I was challenged to do:</p>
<p>Lose your religion, and see what happens</p>
<p>Kiss another guy, and see what happens</p>
<p>Change your career, and see what happens</p>
<p>Speak up for yourself, and see what happens</p>
<p>After having the courage to try something new, I discovered that the only thing holding me back was the cage that I and other people had built for myself. I am now free of fear and supersititons. </p>
<p>The world is not moved forward by people who hold on to fear of the unknown or people who think they know for sure what the future holds. </p>
<p>It is moved forward by the dreamers, who are not afraid to imagine the possibilities and make them reality. </p>

<p> That is why I made this collection of incredible stories. I encourage you to listen to the possibilities that other people were courageous enough to discover. Ponder the people who weilded fear and needlessly harmed other people. </p>
<p> Don't hold yourself back. You don't know what the future holds - nobody does.  </p>
<p> Dream away. Experiment. Wonder. Wander. Travel. Love. Enjoy. </p>
